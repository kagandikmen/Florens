# When-to-Plant

A small command-line tool written in Python which takes

meteorological data from [Open-Meteo Weather API](https://open-meteo.com)\
soil composition data from [Soilgrids REST API](https://rest.isric.org/)

and checks if the next 7 days are optimal for planting a particular plant specified by the user.

## Current Status

The general structure is completed and works fine. More plant types should be added. Unneeded API accesses can be removed to
improve speed. 

## Contributing

Pull requests, suggestions, bug fixes etc. are all welcome. I would be more than glad if you're an expert in agricultural science wanting to contribute.
