# When-to-Plant

A small command-line tool written in Python which takes meteorological data from [Open-Meteo Weather API] (open-meteo.com) and 
checks if the next 7 days are optimal for planting a particular plant specified by the user.

## Current Status

The general structure is completed and works fine. More plant types should be added. Unneeded API accesses can be removed to
improve speed.
